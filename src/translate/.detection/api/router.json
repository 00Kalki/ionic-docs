For Angular projects, use [`ion-router-outlet`](../router-outlet) and the Angular router.\n\nApps should have a single `ion-router` component in the codebase.\nThis component controls all interactions with the browser history and it aggregates updates through an event system.\n\n`ion-router` is just a URL coordinator for the navigation outlets of ionic: `ion-nav`, `ion-tabs`, and `ion-router-outlet`.\n\nThat means the `ion-router` never touches the DOM, it does NOT show the components or emit any kind of lifecycle events, it just tells `ion-nav`, `ion-tabs`, and `ion-router-outlet` what and when to \"show\" based on the browser's URL.\n\nIn order to configure this relationship between components (to load/select) and URLs, `ion-router` uses a declarative syntax using JSX/HTML to define a tree of routes.\n\n## Interfaces\n\n### RouterEventDetail\n\n```typescript\ninterface RouterEventDetail {\n  from: string | null;\n  redirectedFrom: string | null;\n  to: string;\n}\n```\n\n### RouterCustomEvent\n\nWhile not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.\n\n```typescript\ninterface RouterCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {\n  detail: RouterEventDetail;\n  target: HTMLIonRouterElement;\n}\n```\n",
