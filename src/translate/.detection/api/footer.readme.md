# ion-footer

Footer is a root component of a page that sits at the bottom of the page.
Footer can be a wrapper for ion-toolbar to make sure the content area is sized correctly.

## Fade Footer

The `collapse` property can be set to `'fade'` on a page's `ion-footer` to have the background color of the toolbars fade in as users scroll. This provides the same fade effect that is found in many native iOS applications.
