# ion-content

The content component provides an easy to use content area with some useful methods
to control the scrollable area. There should only be one content in a single
view.

Content, along with many other Ionic components, can be customized to modify its padding, margin, and more using the global styles provided in the [CSS Utilities](/docs/layout/css-utilities) or by individually styling it using CSS and the available [CSS Custom Properties](#css-custom-properties).


## Fixed Content

In order to place elements outside of the scrollable area, `slot="fixed"` can be added to the element. This will absolutely position the element placing it in the top left. In order to place the element in a different position, style it using [top, right, bottom, and left](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position).

## Interfaces

### ScrollBaseDetail

```typescript
interface ScrollBaseDetail {
  isScrolling: boolean;
}
```

### ScrollDetail

```typescript
interface ScrollDetail extends GestureDetail, ScrollBaseDetail {
  scrollTop: number;
  scrollLeft: number;
}
```

### ScrollBaseCustomEvent 

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing on the `ionScrollStart` and `ionScrollEnd` events.

```typescript
interface ScrollBaseCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  detail: ScrollBaseDetail;
  target: HTMLIonContentElement;
}
```

### ScrollCustomEvent 

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing on the `ionScroll` event.

```typescript
interface ScrollCustomEvent extends ScrollBaseCustomEvent {
  detail: ScrollDetail;
}
```
