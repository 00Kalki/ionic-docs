# Adding Credentials

After you have generated your Security Profile, you must upload it to Ionic Appflow. Navigate to your App, then click on Package Tab and choose Certificates on the left hand side.

Click the **Add Profile** button to create a new Profile. Both iOS and Android certifications can be used with one Profile, so we recommend making things like "Real App Store Profile", etc.

Once that Profile has been created, click the **Edit** button for it and upload your iOS and Android certs.
