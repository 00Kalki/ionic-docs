# Packaging Native Binaries

Ionic Appflow's Package feature makes it easy to build native app binaries for iOS and Android in the cloud. Perfect for automating binary builds and for developers using Windows that want to build iOS apps.

## Getting Started

To start, you'll need to upload iOS and/or Android certificate profiles to enable Package to build your app in the cloud.

Get started with security profiles [here](/docs/appflow/package/credentials).
