# Ionic API

In the API docs, you'll find two kinds of doc pages: _Component_ and _Programmatic_ APIs.

The _Component APIs_ include classes like [`Checkbox`](/docs/api/checkbox), [`Toggle`](/docs/api/toggle) or [`Item`](/docs/api/item) and show you how to use them, in addition to listing their selectors, available properties and events.

---

The _Programmatic APIs_ are classes like [`MenuController`](/docs/api/menu-controller), `Config` or `Platform`.
These are services provided by Ionic that can be injected into your classes.
