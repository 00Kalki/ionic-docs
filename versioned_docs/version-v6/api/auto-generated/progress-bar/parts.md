| `progress` | The progress bar that shows the current value when `type` is `"determinate"` and slides back and forth when `type` is `"indeterminate"`. |
| `stream` | The animated circles that appear while buffering. This only shows when `buffer` is set and `type` is `"determinate"`. |
| `track` | The track bar behind the progress bar. If the `buffer` property is set and `type` is `"determinate"` the track will be the width of the `buffer` value. |
