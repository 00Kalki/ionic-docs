| **Description** | Call `complete()` within the `ionInfinite` output event handler when your async operation has completed. For example, the `loading` state is while the app is performing an asynchronous operation, such as receiving more data from an AJAX request to add more items to a data list. Once the data has been received and UI updated, you then call this method to signify that the loading has completed. This method will change the infinite scroll's state from `loading` to `enabled`. |
| **Signature** | `complete() => Promise<void>` |
