## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

## Editing Content

The content is written as Markdown and stored in `src/documents`. Each Markdown file corresponds to a route. For example, `src/documents/intro.md` contains the content for the route `/docs/intro`. After you've made changes, you'll need to rebuild the documents:

```shell
npm run build-documents
```
